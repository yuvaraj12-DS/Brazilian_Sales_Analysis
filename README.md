## Insights & Conclusion
**Order Trends** — Orders increased sharply from 2017 (90,202) to 2018 (108,022), showing strong growth.  
**Installment Payments** — Nearly 99.99% of customers preferred installments, reflecting a strong demand for flexible payments.  
**Customer Geography** — São Paulo (SP) led with the most customers, followed by Minas Gerais (MG) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ).  
**Seasonality** — Orders peaked in May, July, and August, making these months ideal for promotions.  
**Product Preferences** — Categories like `Bed Table Bath`, `Health Beauty`, and `Computer Accessories` contributed most to sales.  
**Price vs. Popularity** — Higher-priced products tend to sell less often (slight negative correlation).  
**Top Sellers & Customers** — A few sellers and customers contribute most revenue, creating dependency risks.  
**Retention & Sales Momentum** — Sales showed remarkable growth (12,112% increase in early years), but retention rates remain low, signaling a need for loyalty-building strategies.

4. **Expand Key Product Categories** — Introduce premium products in top-selling categories to drive growth.  
5. **Diversify Seller Base** — Onboard more sellers to reduce dependency on top-performers.  
6. **Seasonal Campaigns** — Launch targeted promotions during peak months (May–August).  
7. **Balance Pricing Strategies** — Offer discounts or value bundles for higher-priced items to improve their sales.
